# Multidisplinary Engineering
This project was to make a rc car that used bluetooth to control the car from a PC. With this project I worked with a Mechanical Engineer, a Chemical Engineer, and a Electric Engineer to design a car that could go through an obsticle course. In this multidisplinary setting my main objectives were coding both the pc and microcontroller and helping each disiple test their respected tasks.

### production
This is the code that goes into the final product

##### RC-Car-Microcontroller.ino
Microcontroller's code for car functionality
##### RC-Interface.py
PC code for sending bluetooth commands to the rc car

### test
This is code that was used while testing the car in the Maker's Space

##### wireless-test.py
PC code for quick editing to test certain commands.
