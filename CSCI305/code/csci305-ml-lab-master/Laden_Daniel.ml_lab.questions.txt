2.add one to each element in the list
3.If there is an empty list it returns an empty list catches nil lists
4. Takes the first element of the list x and adds one then recursively calls the next element using f xs (xs being the rest of the list till it is nil)
6. Tail-recursion
8. The easiest thing to say about this is tail-recursion is what's used by most compilers so the compiler is optimized to read tail recursion better than general
11. Forced Recursion is good to learn how to recurse functions better
12. Making the thing run, SML gave me an error at every point it possibly could and it was mindnummingly stupid to me
13. Fuck this language dude, I didn't enjoy this at all and it made me had functional langauges as a whole I hope other functional langauges are better than this experience in everyway. If there is a good nice and happy functional language PLEASE let me know I want to know and appriciate these guys
14. I don't know 20-40 probably
15. H-e-double tooth picks no. I would go great lengths to never use ML again.
